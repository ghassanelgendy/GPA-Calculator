# GPA Calculator

This is a simple web application that allows users to calculate their GPA based on their course grades and credit hours. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is designed to calculate GPAs according to the Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence (FCAI) at Cairo University.

## Features

- Input fields for course name, credit hours, and grade
- Ability to add multiple courses through multiple semesters 
- Ability to save inputted course data for future use
- Responsive design for use on desktop and mobile devices
- "How it works" [link](https://ghassanelgendy.github.io/GPA-calculator/bylaw-page-12.pdf) that explains the calculations used to determine GPA, based on the bylaws PDF provided by the university

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by Omar Ahmed and the [GPA FCAI app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HANZO.gpa_fcai) by Mohamed Ehab. I wanted to create a similar tool that would allow students to easily calculate their GPA according to the FCAI guidelines, without the need for a mobile or desktop app.

## Getting Started
